### Description

Regular updates, applied in a timely manner, are one of the most effective ways to protect a website. Critical security issues in CMS are often used for automated attacks in just a couple of hours after an update has been released, so staying up-to-date is extremly important.

### Background

Security-relevant updates for popular Content-Management-Systems (CMS) are released on a regular base, therefore it's important to keep the CMS version up-to-date.

### Consequence

Using outdated CMS versions allows attackers to attack a site using well-known attacks, that have been fixed in up-to-date CMS versions. A successful attack often allows full control over the website.

### Solution_Tips

If your CMS was reported as old, update your CMS-Installation. Normally, smaller updates within the same version branch (i.e. from 1.5 to 1.6) can be applied with just a mouseclick directly from the CMS administration interface. Bigger update leaps (i.e. from 1.5 to 2.0) often require adjustments to the actual site's code and therefore have to be applied by the initial website developer. Please create a backup before each update.

Check your CMS at least once a day for available updates. If you aren't able to do so, making a maintenance-contract with a service provider is highly recommended!
